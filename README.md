 ### interpreted & compiled programming languages
 
 #### interpreted programming languages
  
  > since this language is not compiled, everybody will be needing an interpreter to be able to execute the code itself
  
 interpreted programming languages are slower than compiled programming languages, they also go through a program line by line and they execute each command
 also, it can be modified while you are working on them, so you can make changes on the go and also check the results
 
  
| pros | cons |
| ----------- | ----------- |
